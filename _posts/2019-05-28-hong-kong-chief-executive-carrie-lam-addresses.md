It is intriguing to watch high profile **#leaders** perform under conditions of extreme pressure and in the video below, Mdm. Carrie Lam delivers her apology to the Hong Kong people. Whatever your political stance is on this, people HAVE to be offended by this insult of a  question from the CBS reporter, "Critics have said that you are a habitual liar and that you have to cry today to be believed. How do you feel about that?" (full clip found at 30.55 min.) Habitual liar, I don't care. But 'cry'? Seriously? It is offensive, sexist and totally degrading. The sting of the insult comes from the realization that such a comment would never be delivered if a man was standing at that podium. 

**#sexism #discrimination #racism**
