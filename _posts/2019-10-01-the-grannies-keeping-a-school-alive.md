These grannies may be keeping a school alive but I wonder if they realize that their actions are a powerful influencer for those of us who work everyday to effect impactful and sustainable social change. Such results can only be achieved through relentless innovation, being responsive to emerging needs, unwavering commitment to the greater good and tireless dedication to keep it going. To all of you out there doing such work, I SALUTE all of you. Too often, the work is unrecognized, under-appreciated and undervalued. But when we see impact such as in this article, the reward is deeply satisfying & simply priceless.
