This article resonates because many will relate to it. Discrimination IS hard to prove, and so is bullying, harassment, racism and all other insidious acts of violations that leaves no visible signs of injury. Worst yet, even when there are witnesses to the act, the onus still lies on the victim to prove that damage was done. Truth is, most people choose to look away, stay silent or worse, submit to the power of the perpetrator. Until and unless more people speak up and speak out against all violations of basic human rights, the suffering and injustice will remain. Every voice matters and it all begins with just one voice.
