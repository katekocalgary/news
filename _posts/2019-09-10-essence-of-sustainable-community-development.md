It does take a whole community of supports to effect transformative change. Our latest project involve tackling seniors social isolation in the North Calgary region. It took 6 months of painstaking efforts & a never-say-die spirit to get the results we saw today - a class full of immigrant seniors showing up to learn basic English conversation. I wish you could see the smiles, hear the laughter, feel the sense of accomplishment as one after another, reluctant English speakers speak their first complete sentence in English. High fives were flying all over the room! 

Results such as these took piecing together collaborations from all possible stakeholders - every community association in the area, the local library & recreation organization, the City of Calgary Government of Alberta, Josephine Pon  local ethno-cultural organizations & other grassroots groups, and hours of volunteer labour. This in a nutshell is the very essence of sustainable community development - an initiative that benefits the local community, made possible by the combined efforts of the local community and built-in sustainability achieved through the volunteer efforts of the local community. Together Everyone does Achieve More!
