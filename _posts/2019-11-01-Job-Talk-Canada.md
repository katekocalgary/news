The first JobTalk class was delivered in 2008 in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. This course was designed and delivered by Mae Chun, a Canadian professional with over 10 years of experience working with new immigrants to Canada and helping them find meaningful work. 

Participants are equipped with knowledge of the Canadian job market, understand the job application process and learn the right way to apply for jobs in Canada. In addition, students gain insights into Canadian culture, especially culture in the workplace. Over the years, JobTalk has been credited with helping many new immigrants from all over the world find work, from entry level to professional jobs. Such countries include China, Taiwan, Korea, Japan, India, Brazil, Columbia, Peru, Nigeria, Kenya, England, Scotland, Egypt, Iran and many more. Repeatedly so, many students expressed the need for such information to be available in their home countries. 

We listened. JobTalkCanada is the result and its primary mission is to provide updated, reliable and relevant job search information to those wishing to immigrate to Canada. Our services to job seekers who are new to Canada are based on the collective experiences of many qualified, experienced and passionate individuals interested in the success of new Canadians. JobTalkCanada is an information hub and a skills training medium.
