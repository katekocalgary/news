Age discrimination in the workplace is real, pervasive and affects workers of all ages. But for those who are past 55, the implications can be profound and life-altering (and not in a good way). Many of us can relate to the struggles of finding meaningful work beyond a certain age and the process of doing that impacts our sense of self-worth, the notion of 'usefulness' to society, the feeling of significance and contribution. Consciously or unconsciously, our sense of 'usefulness' is tied to that paycheck. Bottom line is, we can't control how others behave, think or treat us but what we CAN control is how we respond, how we value ourselves and how we CHOOSE to use the wealth of experience, skills and knowledge to the benefit of others. Ditch the victim mentality. Reach out and support one another.  **#wellness #wecan #worth #self**
